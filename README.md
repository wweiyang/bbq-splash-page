# BBQ splash page

A splash page for signing up for a BBQ session. This project was to learn responsive design, taking the mobile-first approach when creating the page. Forms, gradients, transitions, and background images were also introduced in this project.

## Overall process of the project:

- Based on the given design, break it up into sections
- Come up with the basic HTML structure based on these sections
- Add CSS styles, mobile-first approach
- Add CSS media queries for larger screen size
- Add the form and style it
- Add submit function for the form using Javascript

There weren’t many difficulties faced in this project. However, it did take some time to figure out the best way to structure the different elements, and also what styling to use.
